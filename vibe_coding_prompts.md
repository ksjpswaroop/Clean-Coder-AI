Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to implement the UFly project based on the user story provided. The user has given a lot of details about what they want, including key features, technical requirements, system architecture, and more. My task is to generate a detailed coding prompt for a developer to implement this.

First, I need to understand the scope of the project. It's a mobile app with both iOS and Android versions, along with a backend system. The backend needs to be cloud-based using either AWS or GCP. There are specific databases involved: PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for logs and analytics. 

The mobile app should allow users to book rides, track them in real-time, handle payments securely, and access customer support. The vehicle maintenance part is interesting because it involves integrating with the CAN Bus Protocol, which I'm not too familiar with, but I know it's used in automotive systems for communication between components.

I also notice that APIs are a big part of this project. They need to be RESTful for communication between the mobile app and backend, and MQTT for real-time data from vehicles. Security is another key area—encryption, secure storage, and compliance with regulations like GDPR and aviation standards.

Looking at the system architecture, it's divided into four layers: UI, Application (business logic), Data (storage), and Integration (third-party services). This separation makes sense for modularity and maintenance. The communication flows from mobile to backend via REST and between backend and vehicles via MQTT.

The user also mentioned scalability through horizontal scaling and load balancing, which means I need to ensure the system can handle increased traffic without performance issues. Maintenance includes scheduled inspections and predictive analytics using AI/ML, so I'll have to think about how to integrate those features.

I'm a bit confused about how exactly the CAN Bus Protocol integrates with the backend. Do they need middleware or specific adapters? Also, the user asked about authentication methods beyond secure storage—maybe implementing multi-factor authentication would be good for security.

To structure this into a coding prompt, I should break it down into sections: project overview, key features, technical requirements, system architecture, and acceptance criteria. Each section needs to be detailed enough so that a developer can understand what's needed without ambiguity.

I also need to make sure the prompt is clear about the technologies to use—Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS or GCP for the backend. The APIs should follow RESTful standards, and MQTT for real-time data. Security measures like encryption and secure storage are non-negotiable, along with compliance with relevant regulations.

In terms of scalability, I'll mention horizontal scaling and load balancing. For maintenance, scheduled inspections and predictive analytics using AI/ML should be included. The user also mentioned future features like autonomous flights and eVTOL expansion, so those could be part of the roadmap but might not be immediate priorities for the initial implementation.

I think including areas for further exploration in the prompt would help the developer understand where to focus next, such as detailed CAN Bus integration or more robust authentication methods. This way, the prompt serves both as a starting point and a guide for future enhancements.

Overall, I need to ensure that the coding prompt is comprehensive, covering all aspects of the project from frontend to backend, including databases, APIs, security, scalability, and maintenance. By organizing it into clear sections with specific details, the developer can proceed methodically without missing any critical components.
